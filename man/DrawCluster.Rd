\usage{
DrawCluster(data, label = NULL, point_size = 1, method = c("tsne", "umap"), draw_cluster_text = TRUE, calculated = TRUE, pca = TRUE, perplexity = 100, plot = TRUE, seed = 1)

\arguments{
  \item{data}{
  A matrix with column is sample, row is feature.
}
  \item{label}{
  A vector showing the sample label corresponding the colnames of the matrix "data".
}
  \item{point_size}{
  The size of point. Default is 1.
}
  \item{method}{
  The method to plot which should be one of "tsne" and "umap". Default is "tsne".
}
  \item{draw_cluster_text}{
  TRUE by default. If TRUE, the cluster label will be drawed in the corresponding place in the graph.
}
  \item{calculated}{
  TRUE by default. If FALSE, "tsne" or "umap" will not be performed, the graph will be draw with data offered directly.
}
  \item{pca}{
  TRUE by default. If FALSE, pca will not be performed.
}
  \item{perplexity}{
  Default is 100.
}
  \item{plot}{
  FALSE by default. If TRUE, plot the graph.
}
  \item{seed}{
  Default is 1.
}
}
\value{
\item{p }{The ggplot object for plotting.}
\item{x }{A matrix showing coordinates calculated by "tsne" or "umap".}
\item{cell_group}{A vector showing the cell label.}
