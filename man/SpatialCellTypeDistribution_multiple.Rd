\usage{
SpatialCellTypeDistribution_multiple(sample_information_coordinate_list, sequence_resolution = c("single_cell", "spot"), sample_information_cellType_list = NULL, sample_information_decon_list = NULL)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{sample_information_coordinate_list}{
    A list of data frames, each of which shows coordinates of cells/spots for each slice. The rows of data frame are cell/spot names, and the columns are coordinates "X" and "Y".
}
  \item{sequence_resolution}{
    Character. The resolution of spatial transcriptomics. "single_cell" means single-cell resolution. "spot" means non-single-cell resolution.
}
  \item{sample_information_cellType_list}{
    A list of vectors, each of which shows cell type lables of each cell/spot. The names of each vector should be cell/spot names.
}
  \item{sample_information_decon_list}{
    A list of data frames, each of which shows deconvolution result of spots. The column is cell type name. The row is spot name.
}
}
